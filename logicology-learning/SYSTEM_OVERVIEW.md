### Development Workflow
1. **TypeScript First**: All code written in TypeScript
2. **Component-Driven**: Reusable UI components
3. **API-First**: tRPC for type-safe communication
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design approach

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: Clerk handles secure login/logout
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **API Security**: Protected procedures with middleware
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for input validation
- **File Security**: Secure uploads with UploadThing

## 🚀 Deployment & DevOps

### Container Setup
- **Docker**: Multi-stage build for production
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy with SSL support
- **MongoDB**: Containerized database

### CI/CD Pipeline
